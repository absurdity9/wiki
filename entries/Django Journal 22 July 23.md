I spent an hour stuck trying to debug why my form isn't showing up on the page. It is frustrating especially because it feels like time has been wasted. I must make sure I learn from each mistake because I paid a heavy price for it both in terms of time and energy. I don't want to repeat the same mistake because it is a lesson paid for but not learnt.

Back to the debugging, it turns out it is because when I defined my form class I put commas after each form field. Why? Why does putting a comma after defining each form field lead to problems? It turns out that by adding a comma after each field definition in the form class, Python interprets each field as a tuple instead of a class attribute. The form class is expecting an attribute, not a tuple so it doesn't work when it renders.
